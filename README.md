# echoband ðŸŽ§

**echoband** is a wearable sound visualizer that turns ambient audio into reactive light. using fft audio analysis on an esp32 with a max9814 microphone, it maps real-world sound into dynamic led patterns with a ws2812b strip.

built as part of [hack club's highway to undercity](https://hackclub.com/highway/), echoband is perfect for concerts, accessibility, and artistic self-expression.
