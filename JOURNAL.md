# june 2: kickoff

started planning echoband, a wearable led band that reacts to real-world sound using an esp32 + max9814 mic. picked out components: esp32 dev board, neopixel (ws2812b) led strip, mic, battery charger. sketched a rough idea of the wristband form + how the leds could animate to sound. also made this repo & added folders to stay organized.

**next up:** wiring mic â†’ analog read test

**total time spent: 1.5h**

# june 3: pre-submission work

finalized readme + code, wrote my `#highway-pitstop` post, and opened a pull request to add echoband to the gallery. also filled out the project submission form. still no parts, but feeling confident about the setup.

**total time spent: 1h**
